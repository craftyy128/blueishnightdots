find the configs in the repo files they are named accordingly


put the minimal fastfetch config in a folder in the home directory called "keep" so it would be ~/keep/os.jsonc



the normal fastfetch conf is for when you run the fastfetch command the minimal one is for when you open terminal

 nerd font required i use jetbrains mono
starship conf is in repo and add it by doing

mv ~/Downloads/starship.toml ~/.config/starship.toml
